    "Decision trees are supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. Tree models present a high flexibility that comes at a price: on one hand, trees are able to capture complex non-linear relationships; on the other hand, they are prone to memorizing the noise present in a dataset. By aggregating the predictions of trees that are trained differently, ensemble methods take advantage of the flexibility of trees while reducing their tendency to memorize noise. Ensemble methods are used across a variety of fields and have a proven track record of winning many machine learning competitions. In this lesson, we'll learn how to use Python to train decision trees and tree-based models with the user-friendly scikit-learn machine learning library. We'll see the advantages and shortcomings of trees and demonstrate how ensembling can alleviate these shortcomings, all while practicing on real-world datasets."

Our goal is to find the model complexity that achieves the lowest generalization error. Since this error is the sum of three terms with the irreducible error being constant, we need to find a balance between bias and variance because as one increases the other decreases. This is known as the bias-variance trade-off.\n",
